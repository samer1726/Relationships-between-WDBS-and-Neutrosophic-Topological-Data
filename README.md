# Relationships-between-WDBS-and-Neutrosophic-Topological-Data

**File 1 (Women Breast Cancer Data)**

This dataset focuses on different measurements associated with both benign as well as malignant tumors and includes medical diagnostic information for patients with breast cancer. A number of parameters, including radius, surface texture, boundaries, area, softness, and other statistical metrics that are essential for examining tumor characteristics, are included in the file. Each entry represents the physical characteristics of a tumor and is categorized into two categories: benign or malignant. This dataset is frequently used in predictive modeling and machine learning to differentiate between tumors that are benign and malignant based on their characteristics.

**File 2 (Neutrosophic Topological Data)**

This dataset has been converted into neutrosophic topological data, which is a complicated structure used for imprecise and uncertain data analysis. When confusing or insufficient information causes traditional statistical models to fail, the topological framework utilized on the data enables more precise treatment. For improving decision-making processes in settings with ambiguous or inconsistent data, such as complicated systems analysis or medical diagnostics, this transformation to neutrosophic logic is essential.

**1.**	**Data Structure**: File 1 offers a thorough dataset on breast cancer that uses a variety of tumor features to differentiate between malignancy and benign tumors. The tumors are categorized using these attributes, which include area, texture, and radius. However, file 2 transforms these features into neutrosophic topological data, a potent technique for managing imprecision and ambiguity in medical datasets.

**2.	Improving Diagnosis**: File 2 presents a topological structure that enables better handling of ambiguous or partial data, whereas file 1 employs conventional machine learning techniques to categorize tumors based on precise numerical measurements. Medical data is frequently unclear or lacking in clinical settings. A more reliable assessment of such data is made possible by the neutrosophic technique, which may lead to increases in diagnostic precision.

**3.	Handling Uncertainty**: Because clinical data is not always flawless, the breast cancer dataset may occasionally contain uncertain or missing values. By enabling a visualization of data that might not be entirely accurate or may contain contradicting data, the neutrosophic logic resolves this uncertainty and may aid in improving the analysis of malignant versus non-cancerous states.
